# DETECTION-OF-CHILDREN-LEFT-UNATTENDED-IN-PARKED-AUTOMOBILES-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
DEEP LEARNING PROJECT (my final year project)

This project was developed as an undergraduate final year project and the goal was a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to detect the unattended children left alone in parked cars. CNN was used for facial classification of children and adults in images frames provided in the dataset.

### About the Dataset

Dataset in this repository has a total of 11,582 images to carry out the training of the convolutional network, of this total 8327 are adult face images and 3255 are children face images. These images were extracted from 2 different datasets that are avaliable on:
-UTKfaca database
-LAGdataset_100


### Execute CNN Training

After pre-processing images to build the dataset, the convolutional network can carry out the training stage. Training consists of supervised learning, using 70% of the images and the other 30% for cross-validation tests.
